Beneteau is a family saga that continues to unfold and whose ambition is to make the pleasure of boating and getting away from it all accessible to an even greater number.</p>

				<p>Behind the Cranchi trademark there is one of the oldest and most solid Italian nautical companies, whose origins stretch right back to 1870. This tradition that is now led by the 5th generation is renowned for their highly attractive Italian design and styling and is now a well known producer of luxury powerboats. There are two strict family rules in fact: reinvest the profits to create a future, increasing the quality of the work environments and the quality of the product, and a single figure in overall charge.</p>
